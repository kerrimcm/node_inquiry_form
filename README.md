_____
An inquiry form created for local business owner, Terence, to capture the following information from his curious customers:
- Name
- Email address
- Message 
- Subscribe to newsletter (y/n)

This is served using pure NodeJS without the use of any frameworks or libraries. Once submitted, the information gets saved to the file `userData.txt`

## Getting started
* `git clone` this repo
* Ensure you have NodeJS installed, if not, install node from [their site](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* You can check if you have node installed by running `node -v`
* Run the command `node app.js` 
* Click/copy the link in the terminal http://127.0.0.1:3000 to visit the form
